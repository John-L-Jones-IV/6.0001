This is my solution to Problem Set 2 from MIT OCW 6.0001 Fall 2016 Introduciton to Computer Science and Programing in Python

hangman.py is the main program
test_hangman.py is a unittest module designed to indepentantly test functions in hangman.py

NOTE:
I have noticed a few descripancies between the console output of my solution and the examples of game play given in the problem set assignment pdf. See page 8 of assignment pdf.
1) after incorrect guesses the example decriments by 2 (i.e 5 guesses to 3 guesses) after only one guess of a letter not in the secret word
2) in the assignement, the 'Please guess a letter: _a__' does not actaully prompt a user input.

Since I am doing this as an independant self-learned I do not have the ability to reach out to a TA or Prof. to discuss these descripancies. I have chosen to keep my solution as is.
